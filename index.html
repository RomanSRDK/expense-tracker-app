      content="Expense Tracker App is a fully responsive web application built with React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit, leveraging Redux Persist for persistent global state. Axios is used for handling asynchronous HTTP requests, making the app ready for integration with real back-end APIs. The UI is adaptive across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using a multi-breakpoint layout strategy. Users can add income and expense entries, each categorized for better financial tracking. Forms are implemented using Formik with schema-based validation powered by Yup, ensuring robust input control. Transactions and user data are persisted via localStorage for offline availability. The architecture follows component-based principles with reusable, modular code and conditional rendering. Styling is handled using SCSS modules and clsx for dynamic class management. The project structure supports scalability, includes custom hooks, and is optimized for performance. Deployed on Vercel, it demonstrates strong front-end engineering practices, including CRUD operations, form management, client-side persistence, and responsive design in a production-ready setup."
